# Animated Geometric Illusion

ðŸ¤˜

## Development

```sh
$ npm start
```

## Build

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This will bundle the project into a single minified `bundle.js` file, move any files from `public/` to the `dist/` folder, and link the `bundle.js` with the `index.html`.

This will also create a `dist-zipped/project.zip` file which can be directly imported on [fxhash](https://fxhash.xyz/sandbox/).
